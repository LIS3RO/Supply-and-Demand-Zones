# Supply and Demand Zones
Supply and Demand dictate the price of all goods and services. Having the ability to detect these levels and adapt to the environment it creates can give you an edge in any market.

Historical price data can tell you where a large number of buyers or sellers stepped in to the market. However, it is only an estimate. Supply and Demand levels do not always occur at a single price point. Drawing a single line at a level does not always work. Considering that the supply and demand levels cover an entire zone may help you strategize better.
